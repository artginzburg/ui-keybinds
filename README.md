# UI Keybinds

The killer feature is the ability to use the UI with keyboard only, with no pain.

E.g. `MM` on Title Screen joins the first server in your multiplayer list.

## Keybinds

There are currently the following keybinds:

- **Main Menu**
  - `S` to open the World Selection Screen
  - `M` to open the Server Selection Screen
  - `MM` to join the first server in your server list
- **World Selection Screen**
  - _Searchbox is automatically selected when opening screen so you can start typing immidiately_
  - `Enter` to join the top-most world on the search list
- **Server Selection Screen**
  - `M` to join the first server in the server list
  - `A` to add new server
  - `D` to open the direct connect screen (not implemented yet)
  - `1-9` to join the corresponding server in the server list
- **Server Disconnect Screen**
  - `ESC` to return to Server Selection Screen
- **Creative Menu**
  - `Tab` to automatically switch to the search page and automatically select textbox
  - `Tab` when you have the textbox selected to clear it

Im open to [suggestions](https://github.com/artginzburg/ui-keybinds/issues) for more keybinds!

## Why can't I rebind these keys in controls?

This mod does not use the minecraft keybinding system, so as to prevent conflicts (ex. `S` to open world selection screen would block movement backwards).

You can code a ModMenu integration for user config — I'll accept PRs for that as soon as possible.
